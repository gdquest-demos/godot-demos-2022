## Overlap
When multiple points and edges overlap, it can be ambiguous what clicking will do.
SmartShape adheres the following rules:
- If a control point overlaps a vertex, the control point takes priority
- If a control point or vertex overlaps an edge:
  - Clicking will move the control point or vert
  - Clicking while holding ALT will create new point on the edge
